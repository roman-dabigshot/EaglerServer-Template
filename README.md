## Eaglercraft-Server-Paper

Premade server template for 1.21

Use the `run.bat` file to run on Windows, or `run.sh` to run on macOS or Linux. The server uses port 25565 for both Vanilla and Eaglercraft players.

Based on EaglercraftXServer, EaglercraftXRewind, ViaVersion, SkinsRestorer, and AuthMeReloaded.

(added EaglerMOTD - remove if u want)

**Note:** If you would like to support versions of Eaglercraft 1.5 older than 22w34a (before singleplayer), add `-Deaglerxrewind.oldChunkFormat=true` to the JVM arguments in the run script. This will perform worse for both clients and the server, but will be compatible with every version of 1.5 going back to 2020.
